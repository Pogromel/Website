                <p>In 2021, I worked on my college team project called Kang, which was the first game I ever made using Unity. It was a 2D platformer game. Since my art skills weren't very good, I used many assets from the internet, mainly from Kenny. Despite this, I came up with the ideas for the hunter and kangaroo characters. I also modified the hunter model to create a hunter boss, making small changes to show it was a boss fight.</p>
                <p>This project taught me a lot about using the Unity engine. I learned how to navigate around Unity and how to use its features to make a game. Working on Kang was a big step for me in understanding game development and design.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Gameplay:</p>
                <p>Kang is a game about a kangaroo whose child is stolen by brutal hunters. Your objective is to get through four levels, with the final level featuring a boss fight where you must defeat the hunter boss to rescue the kangaroo's joey. The game includes a main menu with settings that inform the player about the controls. Additionally, the game has both loss and win conditions.</p>
